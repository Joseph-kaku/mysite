# Overview
I had no experience whatsover making web apps and wanted to give it a try. 

I found a tutorial which I will link below that helped me make this TODO web app.

# Web Pages

I had only one page show but then two functions to make a "complete list" disappear and another to make all things listed disappear

# Development Environment

I coded this in Visual Studio Code and ran the server in SSH

I used Python and Django to write this app, with help from HTML, CSS and Java Script

# Useful Websites

* [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phHM6glUURw&t=158s)



# Future Work

* I want to be able to add multiple different features. I had some issues with color as well that I want to get better at
